# Juven Isle

Juven Isle is a tile-laying (actually card-laying) game where you create a map of islands â€“ building connections and deciding when to play your scoring tokens to maximize your score.

When you play a scoring token, you claim a port for one of the 6 factions, and score a point for each matching faction symbol that the new port can connect to. Or... you could play the scoring token as a pirate, which permanently disrupts the map and scores unclaimed ports.

When you score, you draw cards from the deck into your score pile. The total number of points available is limited by the cards remaining in the deck, so if you wait too long your opponents will have claimed them all.
