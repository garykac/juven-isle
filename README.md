# Juven Isle

Juven Isle is a tile-laying (actually card-laying) game where you build a map of islands. Build connections and then decide when to play your scoring tokens to maximize your score.

Total number of points available is limited by the cards remaining in the deck, so if you wait too long your opponents will have claimed them all.
