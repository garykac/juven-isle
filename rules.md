# Juven Isle Rules

# Game Setup (1/3)

* Build Volcano Map in center (see Volcano card)

* Shuffle cards into 2 DRAW DECKS: Blue Green
    * For short 2 player game, use only 2 deck

* Each player should draw 3 cards to form a HAND
    * From either DRAW DECK, but all cards must be drawn from the same deck

* Each player also has a SCORING PILE (initially empty) to track points

* Choose starting player:
    * Player with most 'R's in their name if you can't otherwise agree

# Gameplay (2/3)

Each turn:

* Choose 1 card from your HAND and connect it to the MAP

* Score the card that was just added to the MAP (See "Scoring" card)

    * For each point that you score, take 1 card from a DRAW DECK and add it to your SCORING PILE. Must be from same DRAW DECK.

* Optionally, you may play another card as long as this card connects to the first card you played this turn
    * Connect not through PIRATE, but through Tortuga

* Draw your HAND back up to 3 cards (from a single DRAW DECK)

# End of Game (3/3)

* Game ends immediately when the last card is taken from either DRAW DECK
    * If the last card is drawn while scoring and there are not enough cards for the full amount, then that's really unfortunate, isn't it?

* All players should add remaining cards from their hands to their SCORING PILE.

* Player with the most cards in their scoring pile wins.

* In case of a tie, argue for a bit before playing another game to determine the _real_ winner.

# Volcano Map Setup

Build the Volcano using the double-sided cards

* Flip the Tortuga card in the air (to determine a side randomly) and place in center of table.

* Shuffle the 6 remaining double-sided cards together and draw 3.

* Arrange these 3 cards clockwise around to Tortuga to form a complete volcano

* Set aside the remaining double-sided cards.

# Scoring

* A RESOURCE will score 1 point for each PIRATE it is _directly_ connected to.
    * If there are multiple resources on the card, the player must choose 1 for scoring.

* A PIRATE will score 1 point for each PORT it is _directly_ connected to.

* A PORT will score 1 point, plus 1 additional point for each _matching_ PORT or RESOURCE it is connected to.
    * PORTs can connect _through_ other PORTS when scoring.

* Tortuga (on one of the start cards) is both a PIRATE and a PORT that matches any RESOURCE

# Connections

* A connection may not pass through a PIRATE.

* A DIRECT connection is one that does not pass through any PORT or PIRATE
    * DIRECT connections are required when scoring a RESOURCE or PIRATE card.

* PORTs can connect through other PORTs when scoring:
    * Even if the PORT resources do not match
    * Even through Tortuga, the PIRATE PORT

# If unable to play a card

At start of turn

If unable to make a valid play with any of your cards, you can XXX. To do this:

* Reveal your cards for all players to see

* If another player finds a valid cards to play, then they are added to the map without scoring.

* You then add any remaining cards directly into your scoring pile.

(does this encourage players to skip playing a single card that scores only 1 point? does that matter?)


# 3 Dec 2020

Resources next to the path vs terminating.
be sure to call out`

is score public?

Ken:
Love tile building from center
Chaining-on-chaining is interesting
    Benefited at end because he drew a bunch of ports
    Got about 21 points on last hand
Almost doubled score in last round

Adam:

Game ends suddenly for 3 player
not an issue to end immediately for 2-player
but does it feel fair to end suddenly with 3 or 4

this version reduced pain of having no point card in hand
2 good / 2 bad
good:
    the puzzle and the map
bad:
    not thinking ahead a lot - tactical play
    didn't feel a lot of agency over scoring
Points are mostly based on what cards you drew: ports = 6pts
would like more strategy so that each card has scoring potential
e.g., strategy for saving for later

wnats to play cards that are investments
    get value later
can pirates be worth a lot under certain circumstances

can players be incentivizes to split the map

because of random draw, at mercy of cards drawn
lucky draw ports

Ken:
likes balance of complexity to investment

Adam:
current game is a better 2-player game
For 3-4 players, need something that can happen during your downtime



Play 1 card per type


# 10 Dec 2020

Draw 3 cards

When you play a Resource, you gain 1 Pirate Point
    Does it need to connect to a Pirate - not allowed, or no pointsmmmmmmmm

Drawing VPs
    draw 1 from each deck, starting with Resource

Turn ends when draw cards

Play Pirate
    # ports x (points/2)

Comments:
Play resource for Pirates or for Ports
    is this an interesting decision

1 deck feels too short

Adam:
issues with R and R on ports for planability
for ports, doesn't feel that it matters whether he gets 2 or 3 points

Ken:
torn
this version led him to make a clever move
    port res & pirate - play in right order
    interesting puzzle to solve
issue with current:
    still decision point is based on cards that are drawn
    decision ends there
    cards are basically the same # of points
not sure if this version is inherently better than the prev version
pirate scoring
    (points /2) * connected ports
    feels finicky

what other decisions cna I make
    when I play a card, is there another decision I can make
cards are worth a similar amount

only decision is what card to draw.

final score: Ken 18, Adam 10, Gary 9

Game end: Ken started and he got the last turn


Adam:

common feedback
puzzle is fun
that takes a bit of time
other players can take your spot  - feel bad (a bit)
linkage between puzzles is simiar
thus build connected map

is there an almost-simultaneous play w/ no hand of cards
can there be card drafting

Ken:
possibly give incentive to place resources that don't connect to paths

Adam:
what is the fun part?
how can we emphasize that?


Similar to Uno
Add abilities to the resource types
How do you target?
    Play pirate, everyone takes a card
    rather than picking someone (cf. chip-taking game)
Catch-up mechanisms

eg. problems with uno
    a lot of fun mechanics also slow the game down

you can add to this base without it getting too complicated

supports 2-6 players with this rule
cf: Bang
    player gets big benefit, everyone else gets smaller benefithttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1169112551
eg: whirlpool
    everyone pass card to left
    discard (redraw?)
cf: Fuji Flush - tag team to get rid of a card

Ken: Pirate games need treasure
Adam: play pirate, add treasure to pile


Game 2 - 10 Dec 2020

Play a pirate, everyone else draws
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1169112551
Are there enough Pirates in deck?
    Need a pirate to play a resource

Clarify: must match corner

Issue: many cards have 2 separate paths but only one path has a symbol
should add symbol to each side
    each path should have a symbol
otherwise you get dead edges that you can't connect anything to


try to give different symbol types



Game 3 - 11 Dec 2020

What happens when decks run out of cards?
How to handle in a satisfying way

Add info on Pirate card to remind people to draw cards.

When does Pirate symbol apply:
    only whne you attach it

Portuga - can Ports connect through it

Portuga is just a Pirate Port - no Resources
exists only to make start avoid all land/water edges
    otherwise can choose random

Feels too easy
how to make Ports more challenging

Treasure cards
can bury cards - discard

Pirates block all directions
Whirlpool - draft cards around table
    person who played Pirate discards the card they would get
Land pirate draw 1
Add icons to indicate action
Discards are placed at bottom of draw deck

Can't play - draw 2
Ports only have ports
    this means that all ports visible on the map - you see a port, you know it's connected
    easier to scan map
    therefore, must connect to all sides (since no dead paths)

See Scuttleship Beach
    Hibiscus has 2 full-land edges - hard to match

cards with 2 land edges or 2 water edges are harder to play
    fewer in deck
    edges act the same because of internal connectivity
consider adding 2 resources on these cards

8 suits
More cards

End of game
Deck runs out - last man standing
    You're eliminated if you need to draw and can't


Next time:
can you draw 2 if you have a valid play? or only if you are blocked?
otherwise, near end of game keep drawing cards if you think the other player is stuck
because they will lose if they are stuck and no cards to draw
and if you have lots of cards in hand, you can keep playing
