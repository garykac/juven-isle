# Juven Isle Rules

# Game Setup (1/3)

* Build Volcano Map in center (see Volcano card)

* Shuffle cards into 2 DRAW DECKS: Blue Green
    * For short 2 player game, use only 2 deck

* Each player should draw 3 cards to form a HAND
    * From either DRAW DECK, but all cards must be drawn from the same deck

* Each player also has a SCORING PILE (initially empty) to track points

* Choose starting player:
    * Player with most 'R's in their name if you can't otherwise agree

# Gameplay (2/3)

Each turn:

* Choose 1 card from your HAND and connect it to the MAP

* Score the card that was just added to the MAP (See "Scoring" card)

    * For each point that you score, take 1 card from a DRAW DECK and add it to your SCORING PILE. Must be from same DRAW DECK.

* Optionally, you may play another card as long as this card connects to the first card you played this turn
    * Connect not through PIRATE, but through Tortuga

* Draw your HAND back up to 3 cards (from a single DRAW DECK)

# End of Game (3/3)

* Game ends immediately when the last card is taken from either DRAW DECK
    * If the last card is drawn while scoring and there are not enough cards for the full amount, then that's really unfortunate, isn't it?

* All players should add remaining cards from their hands to their SCORING PILE.

* Player with the most cards in their scoring pile wins.

* In case of a tie, argue for a bit before playing another game to determine the _real_ winner.

# Volcano Map Setup

Build the Volcano using the double-sided cards

* Flip the Tortuga card in the air (to determine a side randomly) and place in center of table.

* Shuffle the 6 remaining double-sided cards together and draw 3.

* Arrange these 3 cards clockwise around to Tortuga to form a complete volcano

* Set aside the remaining double-sided cards.

# Scoring

* A RESOURCE will score 1 point for each PIRATE it is _directly_ connected to.
    * If there are multiple resources on the card, the player must choose 1 for scoring.

* A PIRATE will score 1 point for each PORT it is _directly_ connected to.

* A PORT will score 1 point, plus 1 additional point for each _matching_ PORT or RESOURCE it is connected to.
    * PORTs can connect _through_ other PORTS when scoring.

* Tortuga (on one of the start cards) is both a PIRATE and a PORT that matches any RESOURCE

# Connections

* A connection may not pass through a PIRATE.

* A DIRECT connection is one that does not pass through any PORT or PIRATE
    * DIRECT connections are required when scoring a RESOURCE or PIRATE card.

* PORTs can connect through other PORTs when scoring:
    * Even if the PORT resources do not match
    * Even through Tortuga, the PIRATE PORT

# If unable to play a card

At start of turn

If unable to make a valid play with any of your cards, you can XXX. To do this:

* Reveal your cards for all players to see

* If another player finds a valid cards to play, then they are added to the map without scoring.

* You then add any remaining cards directly into your scoring pile.

(does this encourage players to skip playing a single card that scores only 1 point? does that matter?)


# 3 Dec 2020

Resources next to the path vs terminating.
be sure to call out`

is score public?

Ken:
Love tile building from center
Chaining-on-chaining is interesting
    Benefited at end because he drew a bunch of ports
    Got about 21 points on last hand
Almost doubled score in last round

Adam:

Game ends suddenly for 3 player
not an issue to end immediately for 2-player
but does it feel fair to end suddenly with 3 or 4

this version reduced pain of having no point card in hand
2 good / 2 bad
good:
    the puzzle and the map
bad:
    not thinking ahead a lot - tactical play
    didn't feel a lot of agency over scoring
Points are mostly based on what cards you drew: ports = 6pts
would like more strategy so that each card has scoring potential
e.g., strategy for saving for later

wnats to play cards that are investments
    get value later
can pirates be worth a lot under certain circumstances

can players be incentivizes to split the map

because of random draw, at mercy of cards drawn
lucky draw ports

Ken:
likes balance of complexity to investment

Adam:
current game is a better 2-player game
For 3-4 players, need something that can happen during your downtime



Play 1 card per type


# Game 1 - 10 Dec 2020

Draw 3 cards

When you play a Resource, you gain 1 Pirate Point
    Does it need to connect to a Pirate - not allowed, or no pointsmmmmmmmm

Drawing VPs
    draw 1 from each deck, starting with Resource

Turn ends when draw cards

Play Pirate
    # ports x (points/2)

Comments:
Play resource for Pirates or for Ports
    is this an interesting decision

1 deck feels too short

Adam:
issues with R and R on ports for planability
for ports, doesn't feel that it matters whether he gets 2 or 3 points

Ken:
torn
this version led him to make a clever move
    port res & pirate - play in right order
    interesting puzzle to solve
issue with current:
    still decision point is based on cards that are drawn
    decision ends there
    cards are basically the same # of points
not sure if this version is inherently better than the prev version
pirate scoring
    (points /2) * connected ports
    feels finicky

what other decisions cna I make
    when I play a card, is there another decision I can make
cards are worth a similar amount

only decision is what card to draw.

final score: Ken 18, Adam 10, Gary 9

Game end: Ken started and he got the last turn


Adam:

common feedback
puzzle is fun
that takes a bit of time
other players can take your spot  - feel bad (a bit)
linkage between puzzles is simiar
thus build connected map

is there an almost-simultaneous play w/ no hand of cards
can there be card drafting

Ken:
possibly give incentive to place resources that don't connect to paths

Adam:
what is the fun part?
how can we emphasize that?


Similar to Uno
Add abilities to the resource types
How do you target?
    Play pirate, everyone takes a card
    rather than picking someone (cf. chip-taking game)
Catch-up mechanisms

eg. problems with uno
    a lot of fun mechanics also slow the game down

you can add to this base without it getting too complicated

supports 2-6 players with this rule
cf: Bang
    player gets big benefit, everyone else gets smaller benefithttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1169112551
eg: whirlpool
    everyone pass card to left
    discard (redraw?)
cf: Fuji Flush - tag team to get rid of a card

Ken: Pirate games need treasure
Adam: play pirate, add treasure to pile


# Game 2 - 10 Dec 2020

Play a pirate, everyone else draws
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1169112551
Are there enough Pirates in deck?
    Need a pirate to play a resource

Clarify: must match corner

Issue: many cards have 2 separate paths but only one path has a symbol
should add symbol to each side
    each path should have a symbol
otherwise you get dead edges that you can't connect anything to


try to give different symbol types



# Game 3 - 11 Dec 2020

What happens when decks run out of cards?
How to handle in a satisfying way

Add info on Pirate card to remind people to draw cards.

When does Pirate symbol apply:
    only whne you attach it

Portuga - can Ports connect through it

Portuga is just a Pirate Port - no Resources
exists only to make start avoid all land/water edges
    otherwise can choose random

Feels too easy
how to make Ports more challenging

Treasure cards
can bury cards - discard

Pirates block all directions
Whirlpool - draft cards around table
    person who played Pirate discards the card they would get
Land pirate draw 1
Add icons to indicate action
Discards are placed at bottom of draw deck

Can't play - draw 2
Ports only have ports
    this means that all ports visible on the map - you see a port, you know it's connected
    easier to scan map
    therefore, must connect to all sides (since no dead paths)

See Scuttleship Beach
    Hibiscus has 2 full-land edges - hard to match

cards with 2 land edges or 2 water edges are harder to play
    fewer in deck
    edges act the same because of internal connectivity
consider adding 2 resources on these cards

8 suits
More cards

End of game
Deck runs out - last man standing
    You're eliminated if you need to draw and can't


Next time:
can you draw 2 if you have a valid play? or only if you are blocked?
otherwise, near end of game keep drawing cards if you think the other player is stuck
because they will lose if they are stuck and no cards to draw
and if you have lots of cards in hand, you can keep playing



# 1Extra game with Adam/Sverre/Chris

Playing light game
Once yuou get it, it's too easy
Until then, it's takes a while to figure out how to play



# Game 4 - 15 Dec 2020

Pirate block all directions
Port connect all directions
Addtional resources added to card with 2 or more all-land or all-water edges


Draw 7

First player: most recently attacked by pirate, or more recently pirated something

Play only 1 card

Hand shedding game
    win when play last card
Cards must match edge - land water

Symbols must connect to what they want
    Pirates -> Port
    Resources -> Pirate
    Port -> Resource
Pay attention to corners

Pirates block all connections
    cannot pass through
Ports can pass through Ports

Portuga - Piorate Port - Ports can pass through


Canm't play - draw 2


==================

Pirates should be harder to play
Maybe harder to play on average as well

# Game 5 - 15 Dec 2020

Pirates in hand at start of game
Adam 3
Gary 2
Ken 2
Chris

Consider restrictions
Cards must played within N spaces of Portuga
Must form 3x3 square at first, then 4x4
Like:
    Kingdomino - max width
    The Colonists - expands
    Anno 1800

Note: can't play in corners

Ports shouldn't have resources on them
so that you can know that a Port always connects to a R

Endgame
When deck runs out. maybe not great now.
was OK as a fallback, but now it might be too common.

Land pirate - everyone draws
    but no deck - game end?

Ken: what if start card was just a Pirate (not a Port)

Chris:
doesn't like lose once you have no card to draw
    regardless of # of cards in hand
can there be a penalty instead?
    e.g.: play until 3 penalty markers accumulated

Solo victor or single loser (like Cockroach poker)

Coop
    build together
Pirates cause penalty

Ken:
Solo or co-op play are a big selling point
solo emphasizes the puzzle part

Chris:
old game: Izzo  or Izzi 2 (puzzle game)

Adam:
refine how the map grows

refine how the game ends

Penalty cards
whoever draws the last penalty card loses

Chris:
If can't play, mill off deck
widen map if everyone can't play

Adam:
Have card in corner that indicates the map size (3x3)
It's also a penalty card that the player takes when they can't play
Penalty card could be different for each level
    arrange random

Chris:
Penalty card: Find hardest piece to play and use that as penalty card

Game needs to end at this point anyway

Map boundary cards

Draw map boundary card


# 16 Dec 2020

Overview:
Build map by connecting cards
Goal is to get rid of entire hand
Alternate game end - person who is forced to take the last map grid card

Connecting cards to the map:

* Edges must match
* Resources must connect to Pirates (blocked by Ports)
* Pirates must connect to Port (blocked by other Pirates)
* Ports must connect to Resources (blocked by Pirates, may pass through other Ports) 

Rules

Draw 7 cards into hand

Take turns attaching to map

When you play a Pirate card:

* Pirate on Land - everyone else draws a card into hand
* Pirate on Water - whirlpool, everyone passes a card from their hand to player on left
    * card that would go to the player who played the Pirate goes instead to the bottom of the deck

The Grid

One other restriction you need to follow is the Grid

Cards can only be played within the currently active Grid.
Initially 3x3

If you can't play within the Grid, then you must Draw a card

Once all players have passed (and drawn) in a row,
    then the next player (the first one to pass)
    takes the next Grid card to unlock the next level and plays as normal.

When a player takes the last Grid card, then then that player loses the game


3 player
Alex Mont, Velgus, David Rodgers

In common with Tsuro

Looking at edges, symbols, connections
+ distance with map grid


Removed grid restriction after 5x5.
Probably not really needed since the next few cards were placed within the restriction.
But removing the mental load was a relief.

Velgus:
Lots of difficulty
identifying what he could play
easy to forget which symbols connected to which other symbols
    ref card - decorative - but maybe not easy to read
    perhapos all text facing the same direction
"what can i play?"
bigger concern:
    I'm not sure who the target audience
    it might be a bit much for 8+
biggest
difficulty to analyze
difficult to 

strategic element - not a lot
lacks a lot of choice
    lack of meaningful consequences
felt like a jigsaw puzzle

David:
some compatible thoughts as well
agency problems
age of players
    cf candyland - also lack of agency
    but meant to teach how to play
lack of agency doesn't prevent marketability
    but it's not a plus
no gameplay, why would people want to play
problems recognizing what goes where
    fixable in art
only gamestate is
    whether I can play a tile
can I play a tile? yes, no
grid to narrow play to make middle of game too easy
no characterists of area control
reduces to can I play a tile

Alex:
Not a lot of strategy
Just lookign where to play tile

Was pirate shifting worthwhile
like Uno Draw-4

Cannot force opponents to be in a bad position.

David:
biggest issue
80's Bartle 4 basic archetypes
looking at a hand
    different players make diff decisions with same hand


--- other thoughts
R -> Pirate connection was harder to explain thematically
