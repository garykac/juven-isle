SVG File Layers

*** Page Border - "page_border_layer"
	Auto generated
	Hidden in output file.
	
Cut - "cut_layer"
Hidden in output file.

Safe - "safe_layer"

Edge Guides Master - "edge_guides_master_layer"
Contains master copy of the 6 edge guides for each side (24 total)
Move down into the "Edge Guides" layer to activate.
Note: Be sure to move them down in order: top, right, bottom, left since the
	validation script currently just reads them in file order, assuming TRBL order.
*** Not included in output svg file.

Edge Guides - "edge_guides_layer"
Initially empty. Move edge guides from "Edge Guides Master" to activate them.

Resources Master - "resources_master_layer"
Contains master copy of the 6 resources, the pirate and the port circle.
	resource-turtle
	resource-flower
	resource-squid
	resource-coconut
	resource-fish
	resource-banana
	pirate
	port-circle
Move the master copies into the "Resources" layer to activate them.
Note: There is a group for each resource/pirate/port-circle:
	The 'id' in the <g> tag must be before the 'transform' attribute or
	else the wrong transform will be read. This is because the script doesn't
	really parse the SVG file.
	Inkscape preserves the order of the attributes, so this should only be a
	problem when adding new resources to this layer.
Note: For ports, move and rotate the resource and the port-circle together, but
	do not group them.
