Notes for making Island cards

Setup Inkscape
	*** snap to

Notes:
	Union, Difference
		The backmost shape is kept, the others are removed
		This is important when you're merging into a cloned shape
		Make sure the clones shape is the rearmost shape/path
		TODO: is this the same for combine paths

Set page size:
2.5 x 3.5 + 1/8" border for bleed

"Page Border" Layer with outside boundary
	topmost layer
	
"Cut Line" Layer with card cut outline
	Below "Page Border"

*** Set page grid
	Enable alignment
	
*** Create edge guides

"Water"
=======
Create layer below "Page Border"
Rect size of entire page
Fill: rgb 180 220 255
Stroke: None

Lock layer

"Shoreline Master"
==================
Create layer above "Water"
Draw single shape for shoreline
	If multiple islands, combine into a single shape using Path > Union
	Enable the guides and snap to grid to match the edges
Apply "Roughen" Filter
	Filters > Distort > Roughen
	Turbulence
		Base freq: 0.05
		Octaves: 4
	Displacement Map
		Scale: 6.6
In "Filter Editor" rename the filter "Shoreline Roughen"
"Fill and Stroke"
	Set Fill and Stroke to "?"
	This will allow clones to override
	This will turn the shape black
	That's OK because we'll be hiding this layer
The roughen filter will move the shortline a bit
	Adjust points so that the roughened shortline aligns with the guides

"Land"
======
Create layer below "Shoreline Master"
Clone the shape from "Shoreline Master"
	Edit > Clone > Create Clone
Move clone into the "Land" layer
	Layer > Move Selection to Layer Below
Turn off the visibility of the "Shoreline Master" layer
	Only the clone should be visible
	
Select the clone
"Fill and Stroke"
	fill: rgb 255 221 171
	stroke: rgb 95 76 20
		1px wide

"Water Hilight"
===============
Create layer below "Land" (above "Water")
Clone the shape from "Shoreline Master"
	Edit > Clone > Create Clone
	Showing and hiding the layer again
Move clone into the "Water Hilight" layer
	Layer > Move Selection to Layer Below (Twice)
"Fill and Stroke"
	Fill white
	Stroke white 1px
	Blur 5%
In "Filter Editor" rename the filter "Shoreline Water Blur"



*** Water Deep
Below Water Hilight
fill 135 190 255 opacity 65
Blur 10%
Rename filter "Water Deep Blur"

Lock "Land" and "Water Hilight" layers
Turn off visibility of "Shoreline Master" layer


"Paths Master"
=============
Create layer above "Shoreline Master"
Draw paths
	combine multiple paths into a single path
		Path > Combine
	Enable the guides and snap to grid to match the edges
"Fill and Stroke"
	Set Fill and Stroke to "?"
	This will allow clones to override
	This will fill the path with a black fills
	That's OK because:
		we'll be hiding this layer
		otherwise we wouldn't be able to see the path to select it

"Paths Dots"
============
Create layer below "Paths Master"
Clone the path from "Paths Master"
	Edit > Clone > Create Clone
Move clone into the "Paths Dots" layer
	Layer > Move Selection to Layer Below
Turn off the visibility of the "Paths Master" layer
	Only the clone should be visible

"Fill and Stroke"
	Fill: None
	Stroke: black, 2px, round cap, pick any dash pattern

To make a proper dot pattern, we need to edit the paths XML directly
	Select the path and choose Edit > XML Editor
	Select the 'style' for this path
	Change the 'stroke-dasharray' to 0.1 5
		stroke-dasharray:0.1 5
	Press the 'Set' button
	Close the XML Editor

At this point, you may want to move paths to align the dots
	Esp. if you use multiple lines to have the the path split
It's easier to align path dots from the start of the path
	Since there's guaranteed to be a dot there
	Reverse path if necessary to change where the start of the path is
		Path > Reverse
	
"Paths Hilight"
===============
Create layer below "Paths Dots"
Clone the shape from "Paths Master"
	Edit > Clone > Create Clone
	Showing and hiding the layer again
Move clone into the "Paths Hilight" layer
	Layer > Move Selection to Layer Below (Twice)
"Fill and Stroke"
	Stroke: white, 4px
	Blur: 3%
	Opacity: 50%
In "Filter Editor" rename the filter "Paths Hilight Blur"


Lock "Path Dots" and "Paths Hilight" layers
Turn off visibility of "Paths Master" layer


"Grass"
=======
Create layer above "Shoreline Master"
Draw grass shape with the land
	Enable the guides and snap to grid to match the edges
"Fill and Stroke"
	Stroke: None
	Fill: 180 233 130
	Blur: 2%
In "Filter Editor" rename the filter "Grass Blur"

"Forest Master"
===============
Create layer above "Grass"
Draw content
	Draw ovals
	Union them into a single shape
"Fill and Stroke"
	Set Fill and Stroke to "?"

"Forest"
========	
Create layer below "Forest Master"
Clone the shape from "Forest Master"
	Edit > Clone > Create Clone
	Showing and hiding the layer again
Move clone into the "Forest" layer
	Layer > Move Selection to Layer Below
"Fill and Stroke"
	Fill rgb: 108 176 0; HSV: 59 255 88
	Stroke rgb: 0 104 0; HSV: 85 255 52
	width 1.5 px
Apply "Roughen" Filter
	Filters > Distort > Roughen
	Turbulence
		Base freq: 0.15 (Horizontal/Vertical freq 15.0)
		Octaves: 4 (Complexity)
	Displacement Map
		Scale: 6.6 (Intensity)
In "Filter Editor" rename the filter "Trees Roughen"

"Forest Shadow"
===============
Create layer below "Forest"
Clone the shape from "Forest Master"
	Edit > Clone > Create Clone
	Showing and hiding the layer again
Move clone into the "Forest Shadow" layer
	Layer > Move Selection to Layer Below (Twice)
"Fill and Stroke"
	Fill rgb: 37 140 27
	Stroke: None
	Opacity 75%
N2me filter "Trees Shadow Blur"
Apply "Trees Roughen" Filter
	Open Filter Editor
Group Shadow
	Group will only have 1 object in it (the shadow)
	This will allow multiple filters to be applied
	Object > Group
"Fill and Stroke"
	Blur 2%

Lock "Forest" and "Forest Shadow" layers
Turn off visibility of "Forest Master" layer
