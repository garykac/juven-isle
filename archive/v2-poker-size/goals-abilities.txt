*Island Cards*

Each Island card has the outline of part of an island and may contain Ports and resources that
are connected by dotted lines ("routes") on the land and water. They are also marked with the
standard suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades) and values (Ace through King) with 2 Jokers.
Resources can be on land (eg, Pineapples) or in the water (eg, Squid, Turtles) and are always
found along a marked route.

*Goal/Ability Cards*

Each Goal/Ability card contains a goal and may also have a special ability. The card can be
used either for the Goal OR for the Ability, but not both.

Sample Goals:
Connect Port + Pineapple + Squid = 2 VP
Connect 2 Ports + Squid and pass through at least one Heart card = 3 VP
Connect Turtle + Pineapple without passing through a Spade card = 3 VP
Complete an island = 2 VP

Sample Abilities:
Choose 2 Hearts/Spades/Clubs/Diamonds cards in play. Land/water routes on those cards are connected.
Ignore Goal suit restriction for this turn
Choose an island. All routes on that island are connected to each other for this turn.
