Islands

Components:
Island cards
	Each card has some part of an island (or two), some water and 1 or 2 Ports or Resources
Ship tokens - 2 for each player - different colors

Number of players: 2-5?

Resources:
There are 5 types of resource in the game:
	Turtle, Squid, Cannon, Nut (Macadamia) and Pineapple

Setup:
* Shuffle cards
* Deal 5 cards to each player
* Place the all-water card in center of table to start the island map. This is the only card that has no island part (nor Resource) on it.

Each turn:
* Play 1 card from hand
* Draw a new card from deck

When Playing a Card:
Either:
(1) Play a card on the table to build out the islands.
It must properly connect (by sharing at least one edge) to an already-played island card.

(2) Play a card in front of you to bid on the items (Ports, Resources) shown on the card.
The card is worth 1 bidding point total.
When you play a card, you are bidding on the Port or Resource (Turtle, Squid, Cannon, Nut, or Pineapple) shown on the card.
If more than one item is on the card, then the bid is split between all the items (so, 1/2 bid each for Squid and Cannon if they are both on the card used to bid).

When Building the Islands:
* If the card played completes an island AND the player already has a Home Port on this island, then the player can choose to Own this island:
	* Owning an island means that:
		* All the other player's Home Ports are immediately removed from this island (returned to the player).
		* All Cannons on the island are now controlled by the player.
	* If the player does not have a Home Port on the island, then the island is completed, but no single player Owns it.
* If the card played has a Port on it, the player may make it one of their Home Ports by placing one of their two Ship tokens on it.
	* If both of the player's Home Ports are already established, then the player can remove one of the old ones to claim a new Home Port.
	* If there are multiple Ports on a card, the player many only choose at most one.

Ending the game:
The game ends when any player successfully connects their Home Ports to all 5 of the Resource types, using land and/or sea routes.

Scoring:
Note: 'pt' can be interpreted as either 'point' or 'pint' depending of whatever you feel is more appropriate for an island themed game.

* Players earn 4pts for each Resource type they have connected to either of their Home Ports.
	Each resource type is counted once, regardless of how many of that type the Ports are connected to.
	If a player controls a Cannon, then no other player can make use of the sea routes on the card containing the Cannon.

* Players earn 1pt for each card along the shortest land or sea (or combined) path between their 2 Home Ports.
	Ignore the effect of Cannons when determine the shortest path.

* Players each 1pt for each card in each island they Own.

* The player who bid the highest for each Port or Resource earns 2pts for each Resource of that type on the islands.
	All resources of that type are counted, even if they are not connected to anything else.
	If there is a tie for first place, then all tied players receive these pts and the second place award is not given.

* The player who bid the second highest for each Port or Resource earns 1pt for each Resource of that type on the islands.
	Unless there was a tie for the highest bidder, in which case the second place bidder gets nothing.
	If there is a tie for second place, then all tied players receive these pts.
