Intro
players start with no weapons. just a ceremonial knife given to them by the locals.
"weapons may not be taken into the mountains," you are told.  "when you die, the mountains will take your weapons and use them against us."
"these knives," you are told as you are each handed a curved knife with a carved bone handle, "cannot be used by the mountains against us. you may take these with you."

setup:
draw one blessing from the locals

turn:
draw 3 map tiles. choose 1 to add to the map and explore. discard other 2 map tiles.
	you must play a tile if possible
	if multiple match, then you choose which one to play
	if you can't match any, then discard all 3 and heal 1
if tile has a location, then explore location by drawing monster cards equal to the number of stars on the location
	see combat
	after defeating monsters at the location, draw treasure cards

players have 4 treasure slots to hold treasure cards
	multiple cards of the exact same type can be placed in the same slot

for every 2 treasures discarded, players may remove one damage card

combat:
player attacks first, then monster, and so on.
run away - take damage, but no treasure.
	Mark location so others can re-visit.
death -
	if killed, then other players can choose to immediately group up to attack the monster.
	if they are successful, then they save the body which can be returned to town and revived.
	if they don't do this immediately, or if they aren't successful, then the body is gone (consumed, inhabited, who knows?) all equipment lost.
